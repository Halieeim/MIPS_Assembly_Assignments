# MIPS_Assembly_Assignments

> Here is my three assignments:  
>> - Min&Max.asm  
>>> This assignment is about detecting the maximum number and the minimum number of an array of integers and these values are stored in registers $t2 , $t3.  
>> - Subarray_Index.asm  
>>> In this assignment we have two arrays of integers and we're checking if the smaller array is a sub array of the greater array or not, if yes, then we store the index of the first element of the sub array in the greater array in register $t6. if no, then we store -1 in the register $t6.  
>> - Selection_Sort.asm
>>> This assignment is about implementing the selection sort algorithm which is one of data structure's algorithms.
